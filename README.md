# Postur3
An experiement for the ESSS 2017

It uses the LEGO Mindstorms EV3, the Mindstorms IR sensor, an Arduino (Genuino) UNO, the Mindstorms push button and a TFT screen shield for the Arduino (I am using it as the SD card slot). The LEGO Mindstorms EV3 is also using a 3rd party programming block to connect Arduino with the EV3, from dexterindustries.com.
